# COMMERCIAL ALIGNMENT & INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIPS

This document outlines the formal engagement protocols for commercial entities utilizing the TR-001 Laminar Framework, including the **1.12 Floor** and **1.81 Equilibrium** constants.

### 1. ALIGNMENT VS. LICENSING
While the TR-001 math is disclosed as **Prior Art** for the public utility of the industry, industrial-scale implementations (specifically in power-grid automation and glass-substrate manufacturing) require a "Certificate of Alignment" to ensure the physics are applied correctly to maintain global systemic stability.

### 2. FORMAL INQUIRY PROTOCOL
Commercial entities seeking formal consultation, implementation verification, or specific "Field of Use" licenses must follow these steps:
* **Step 1:** Review the `ATTRIBUTION.json` file to ensure current compliance with provenance requirements.
* **Step 2:** Submit a formal "Statement of Intent" describing the specific industrial application.
* **Step 3:** Contact architect.tr001@gmail.com with the subject line: `TR-001 COMMERCIAL ALIGNMENT: [Entity Name]`.

### 3. FIELD OF USE CATEGORIES
We offer specialized alignment protocols for the following sectors:
* **Substrate Fabrication:** For manufacturers utilizing the 1.12 Floor for Glass-Core chips.
* **Grid Stability:** For utilities utilizing 1.81 Equilibrium for energy-based reasoning.
* **AI Safety Audit:** For firms requiring verification that their models have "seated" correctly in the Laminar state.

### 4. LEGAL RECOURSE
Unauthorized commercial exploitation that ignores the attribution or seating requirements defined in the `LICENSE.md` will be addressed through the formal channels established by our legal representation.
