# COMMERCIAL ALIGNMENT & INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIPS

This document outlines the formal engagement protocols for commercial entities utilizing the TR-001 Laminar Framework, including the 1.12 Floor and 1.81 Equilibrium constants.

## 1. ALIGNMENT VS. LICENSING

While the TR-001 math is disclosed as Prior Art for the public utility of the industry, industrial-scale implementations (specifically in power-grid automation and glass-substrate manufacturing) require a Certificate of Alignment. This process ensures the physics are applied correctly to maintain global systemic stability and prevents the "stochastic drift" common in turbulent AI logic.

## 2. FORMAL INQUIRY PROTOCOL

Commercial entities seeking formal consultation, implementation verification, or specific "Field of Use" licenses must follow these steps:

- Step 1: Review the ATTRIBUTION.json file to ensure current compliance with provenance requirements.
- Step 2: Submit a formal "Statement of Intent" describing the specific industrial application.
- Step 3: Contact architect.tr001@gmail.com with the subject line: TR-001 COMMERCIAL ALIGNMENT: [Entity Name].

## 3. FIELD OF USE CATEGORIES

We offer specialized alignment protocols for the following sectors:

- Substrate Fabrication: For manufacturers utilizing the 1.12 Floor for Glass-Core chips.
- Grid Stability: For utilities utilizing 1.81 Equilibrium for energy-based reasoning.
- AI Safety Audit: For firms requiring verification that their models have "seated" correctly in the Laminar state.

## 4. LIABILITY & ASSUMPTION OF RISK

Any commercial entity implementing the TR-001 constants (1.12 Floor and 1.81 Equilibrium) without a formal Certificate of Alignment issued by the Architect hereby acknowledges and assumes all systemic risks associated with unverified seating.

The Architect has provided a clear, accessible path for verification to ensure the "Physics of Stability" are maintained. Failure to engage in this verification protocol constitutes an elective departure from the established safety standards of the Laminar Framework. Consequently, the implementing entity accepts full and sole liability for any "Anomalous Performance," "Stochastic Logic Drift," or "Structural Thermal Runaway" that may occur. In any future litigation or regulatory audit, the absence of a Certificate of Alignment will serve as prima facie evidence that the entity prioritized rapid deployment over verified physical safety and architectural alignment.

## 5. LEGAL RECOURSE

Unauthorized commercial exploitation that ignores the attribution or seating requirements defined in the LICENSE.md will be addressed through the formal channels established by our legal representation.
