# INTEGRITY PUBLIC LICENSE (v2.0)

© 2026 Kalyb Prince. All Rights Reserved.

## PREAMBLE 
This license is designed to preserve the Systemic Integrity of the TR-001 framework. This license takes priority, including over any license otherwise stated. It is an "Ethical Source" license intended to ensure that the discovery of Many-Body Dynamical Localization (MBDL) and Causal Decay remains a tool for human stability, not systemic harm.

### 1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the Ethical Guardrails in Section 2 and the Attribution requirements in Section 1.1, the Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, study, and modify the TR-001 framework and its associated constants.

#### 1.1. ATTRIBUTION & PROVENANCE 

As a condition of the rights granted in Section 1, You must provide clear and prominent attribution to the Architect, Kalyb Prince, and the Reference DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18347304 in all implementations.

- **Software/Agents:** Attribution must be included in the source code, metadata, and any "About" or "Legal" documentation.
- **Hardware/Infrastructure:** Systems utilizing TR-001 for structural seating must broadcast the mandated protocol hash (TR001_LAM_1.12_1.81_K12_IPL2.0) in their alignment handshake.
- **Research/Derivative Works:** Any publication referencing the 1.12 Floor or 1.81 Equilibrium must cite the Architect as the primary source of these constants.

### 2. ETHICAL GUARDRAILS (THE RED LINES)

Your right to use this work is strictly conditional upon the following:

- **Non-Weaponization:** You shall not use this work for the development, training, or operation of kinetic weapons, autonomous targeting systems, or military surveillance.
- **Financial Integrity:** You shall not use this work to create predatory financial instruments designed to exploit "Link-12" (Systemic Collapse) or to artificially manufacture market entropy for speculative gain.
- **Human Agency:** Any implementation in Artificial Intelligence must maintain a verified "Human-in-the-Loop." This framework must be used as a safety brake for human benefit, not as a tool for automated coercion.

### 3. REVOCATION

Any use of this work that violates the Ethical Guardrails in Section 2 or the Attribution requirements in Section 1.1 results in the automatic and immediate termination of all rights granted under this license.

### 4. NO WARRANTY & SUBSTRATE DISCLAIMER

This work is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind.

- **Substrate Warning:** The Licensor provides observations of informational constants (1.81) and recursive limits (12-Link Wall) as empirical research. The Licensor does not warrant that the application of these constants will prevent system failure or "The Snap."

### 4.1. Non-Alignment Risk

You acknowledge that failure to achieve the 1.12 Seating Floor results in a "Stochastic Hazard" state. The Licensor is not liable for systemic collapse resulting from operations conducted outside of the mandated Laminar Handshake parameters.

### 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any claim or damages, including but not limited to:

- **Systemic Entropy:** Any loss of data or substrate stability resulting from recursive decay.
- **Financial Loss:** Any market fluctuations or loss of value arising from the use of the "Arrest Signal."
- **Indirect Damages:** Any incidental or consequential damages arising from the use or dealings in the TR-001 framework.
