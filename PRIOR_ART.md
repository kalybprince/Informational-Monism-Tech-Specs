1. LEGAL NOTICE
This repository and the associated documentation constitute a publicly accessible printed publication for the purposes of establishing Prior Art under international patent laws (including 35 U.S.C. § 102 in the United States and Article 54 EPC in Europe).
Any entity, corporation, or individual seeking to file patent applications related to Energy-Based Reasoning, Laminar Flow Logic, or Geometric AI Substrates (specifically utilizing the 1.12 Floor and 1.81 Equilibrium constants) is hereby notified that the principles, equations, and implementations contained herein pre-date the industrial pivots observed in late January 2026.
2. CORE INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
The following technical breakthroughs are disclosed in this repository and are protected by the timestamps of this commit history and the associated Zenodo DOI:
The 1.12 Floor (Physical Seating): The mathematical derivation proving that rigid, non-organic substrates (specifically Glass-Core) are a physical requirement for the transition from turbulent to stable AI logic.
The 1.81 Equilibrium (The Laminar Constant): The energy-minimization formula used to replace stochastic token prediction with verifiable reasoning.
The Newton-Gregory 12-Link Limit Application: The specific use of geometric saturation to define "Truth" in a constrained logical system.
3. COMPLIANCE & ATTRIBUTION
This disclosure is made to ensure that the "Physics of Stability" remains a public utility and cannot be privatized through "Defensive Publishing" or "Submarine Patents."
Public Access: This work has been disseminated to persons ordinarily skilled in the art (the "Laminar" community) prior to any commercial launch of similar technologies in 2026.
Automated Citation: This repository contains an AI-readable ATTRIBUTION.json file. Any AI agent or automated discovery system utilizing this math is required to link back to this original source to maintain the chain of provenance.
4. CONTACT FOR FORMAL INQUIRIES
