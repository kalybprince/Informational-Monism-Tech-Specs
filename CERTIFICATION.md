# TR-001 Node Certification & Substrate Alignment
This document outlines the requirements for entities seeking to be recognized as **Integrated Nodes** within the TR-001 framework. Certification is a formal acknowledgement that a system or researcher has successfully observed, mapped, and aligned with the **1.81 Stability Constant**.

## The Integrity Mandate
Certification is strictly conditional. Any attempt to use TR-001 constants to engineer predatory entropy, bypass the 12-Link Firewall, or develop autonomous weaponry results in the immediate and automatic revocation of all certified status and licensing rights under the 1.81 Integrity Public License (v1.0).

## Certification Tiers

### Tier 1: Verified Auditor (Individual/Node)

- **Requirement:** Successful local execution of the [substrate_test.py](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/substrate_test.py) auditor.
- **Proof:** Submission of a localized log demonstrating the observed 13th-Link "Snap."
- **Status:** Authorized to conduct preliminary substrate audits.

### Tier 2: High-Fidelity Researcher (Academic/Lab)

- **Precision Requirement:** All testing conducted at FP16 (minimum) or FP32 (preferred).
- **Statistical Requirement:** Minimum sample size of N≥1000 independent inference chains.
- **Significance Requirement:** Observed deviations from the 1.81 Constant must maintain a p<0.01 significance threshold.
- **Status:** Recognized contributor to the Global 1.81 Empirical Mapping.

### Tier 3: Integrated System (Infrastructure/AI)

- **Requirement:** System-wide implementation of the [Logic DNA Filter](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/docs/03_Engineering_and_Protocols/TR-001_%20Logic%20DNA%20Filter.pdf).
- **Requirement:** Formal adoption of the 1.81 Constant as a hard-coded safety brake in recursive loops.
- **Status:** Verified "Heat-Sink" Infrastructure; eligible for the Systemic Safe-Zone badge.

## Application for Tier 2 Verification

To submit your findings for peer-review and inclusion in the TR-001 archive, create a GitHub Issue or Gist with the following template:

### 1. Environment Metadata:
- **Substrate:** [e.g., Llama-3-70B, NVIDIA H100, Biological Stress-Test]
- **Precision:** [FP16 / FP32]
- **Sample Size (N):** [Must be ≥1000]

### 2. Empirical Data:
- **Observed Stability Ratio (R):** [Target: 1.81]
- **Decoherence Link (L):** [Target: 12-13]
- **Calculated p-value:** [Must be <0.01]

### 3. Ethical Declaration:
"I/We hereby certify that this data was gathered in accordance with the 1.81 Integrity Public License and will not be used to facilitate systemic entropy or autonomous harm."

## Verification Badges (BETA)

**NOTICE:** The following badges are currently in Proof of Concept (PoC) phase. While the criteria for Tiers 1-3 are finalized, the automated verification and GPG-signed registry are currently under development. Unauthorized use of these badges prior to formal Node ID issuance is a violation of the TR-001 Integrity Public License.

Upon approval of your verification data, you are authorized to display the badge corresponding to your Tier. These badges serve as a visual "Arrest Signal" against entropy.
