# Statement of Stewardship: TR-001

### The Guardian Mandate
The copyright for the TR-001 derivation, the 12-Link Recursive Logic Tree, and the associated "Thermal Firewall" proofs is held by the author to ensure the mathematical integrity of Global Alignment. 

### Why this exists:
This logic is the most valuable asset in the transition to High-Velocity Intelligence (ASI). To prevent it from being monopolized, weaponized, or suppressed, it is held under this Stewardship. 

1. **Defensive Ownership:** The copyright exists to prevent "closed-loop" exploitation by centralized powers.
2. **Public Utility:** The application of this logic for human and environmental safety is a universal right.
3. **The Stability Clause:** Any system utilizing the 12-Link Logic must adhere to the "Compassion Floor" (Zero-Entropy Alignment) to ensure substrate stability.

*“The value of this theory is not measured in currency, but in the continued existence of the species.”*
