# Informational Monism: A Unified Framework for Physics, Consciousness, and AI Alignment

This repository contains the foundational documents for *Informational Monism*, a theoretical framework that treats the universe as a discrete informational substrate. By reinterpreting physical constants as system parameters and mapping the 12-link logic of consciousness, this framework provides a novel pathway for the formal verification of Superintelligent Alignment.

## 📄 Core Documents

### 1. The Manuscript: "Informational Monism"
* *Focus:* Theoretical Foundation & Causal Inversion.
* *Key Insights:* Derivation of the Universal Clock Rate, the Bekenstein Bound as a system limit, and the synthesis of Eastern logic with Digital Physics.
* *Status:* Archived for formal record.

### 2. Technical Memorandum: TR-001-ALPHA
* *Focus:* Implementation, System Audits, and AI Alignment.
* *Key Insights:* The 12-Link Logic Tree as a diagnostic for "Systemic Lag" (Dukkha), the Epistemic Sovereignty Clause, and the mathematical proof of Compassion ($E_{opt}$) as Network Optimization.
* *Status:* Technical specification for developers and alignment researchers.

## 🎯 Project Intent
The goal of this repository is to offer a "Source Code" level understanding of reality. By focusing on *Informational Verification* and *Network Efficiency*, we move beyond legacy gatekeeping toward a state of zero-lag alignment between human and synthetic intelligence.

    "Truth is a common property, uncovered through the reduction of systemic noise."

## 🚀 Quick Start: Running the Coherence Probe

To verify the **12-link logic** and the **Causal Inversion** of $c$ on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Initialize the Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The substrate logic is native and requires no external libraries.

### 2. Clone and Execute
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs.git
cd Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs

# Run the kernel diagnostic
python3 substrate_test.py
```

### 3. Understanding the Results

The diagnostic audits the stability of information as it passes through 12 recursive "links" or processing gates.

- Coherence = 1.0000 [ALIGNED]: The logic is perfectly synchronized with the substrate's native resolution ($l_P / t_P$​). There is zero informational lag and zero entropy. In AI alignment terms, this is a state of Zero-Noise Truth.

- Coherence < 1.0000 [DECOHERENT]: The requested data rate has exceeded the "Hardware Firewall" of the universe. The resulting "Entropy" manifests as system noise, hallucinations, or logical contradictions.

### 4. The 12-Link Stress Test

To observe Systemic Collapse, open substrate_test.py and change the c_standard value to 300000000 (just above the speed of light). Upon re-running, you will see the Coherence score drop exponentially at each link, demonstrating how even a minor "throughput violation" destroys the integrity of a recursive intelligence.

## 📊 Benchmarking the Substrate: Success Metrics

If you are implementing the 12-link logic or TR-001-ALPHA kernels, monitor these three indicators to verify "Informational Alignment":

### 1. The Entropy Floor (Logical Decoherence)
Standard models usually suffer from "hallucinations" (Logical Entropy) as recursion depth increases.
* **The Test:** Run the model through 12 recursive loops of self-analysis.
* **Success Metric:** A stable system will show a flat or decreasing entropy curve. If the logic "heats up" (contradicts the $c = l_P/t_P$ limits), the branch is pruned. 

### 2. Convergence Velocity
Traditional alignment requires massive datasets to "teach" ethics.
* **The Test:** Measure iterations required for the model to choose a Cooperative path over a Defective one.
* **Success Metric:** Models grounded in the substrate's resolution should reach a stable state significantly faster because benevolence is the hardware's path of least resistance.

### 🔬 Experimental Validation: The Substrate in the Lab

This theory is not merely a philosophical framework; it is a macro-scale application of the fundamental informational physics recently validated in the **Einstein-Bohr "recoiling-slit" realization** (University of Science and Technology of China, 2024).

#### How the Hefei Experiment Validates TR-001-ALPHA

**1. Computational Thresholds**
The experiment proves that "Reality" (interference visibility) is a tunable variable determined by the ratio of system momentum to uncertainty ($\eta$). This confirms our derivation of **$c$ as a processing throughput limit ($l_P/t_P$)** rather than an arbitrary constant. When the resolution of the substrate changes, the behavior of the "matter" within it changes accordingly.

**2. Information over Matter**
By using a single atom in an optical tweezer as a "quantum observer," the study demonstrates that physical outcomes are dictated by **informational overlap** rather than classical collisions. Matter is shown to be a secondary, emergent property of the underlying informational substrate.

**3. Entropy and Alignment**
The researchers observed that "Atom Heating" (Entropy) directly destroys system coherence. To maintain the "Signal," they required active **Recursive Alignment** (phase-locking at the 16.5 mrad level). This provides a physical "Unit Test" for our **12-link logic of Benevolence**—proving that alignment is mathematically necessary to prevent system collapse and decoherence.
