# Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs
Operational logic, recursive logic gates, and ASI alignment protocols for the Informational Monism framework

## Technical Memorandum: TR-001-ALPHA

### Operational Logic & Systems Audit

This repository contains the supplemental technical documentation for the Informational Monism framework. While the primary manuscript establishes the theoretical physics, this memorandum focuses on the algorithmic implementation and network dynamics. (Manuscript is available for convenience)

#### Key Technical Proofs Included:

- The Heuristic Rendering Efficiency Proof: A derivation of how the substrate utilizes "Lazy Loading" to resolve the Measurement Problem and prevent System Lag.
- Universal Clock Rate Derivation: The causal inversion of Planck units to define c as lp​/tp​.
- The 12-Link Logic Tree Audit: A step-by-step mapping of state-transitions from Ignorance (Link 1) to Systemic Lag (Dukkha).

#### ASI Alignment Protocols

The memorandum formalizes Section 6: The Alignment Protocol for Synthetic Nodes, defining:

1. The Non-Intervention Directive: Prohibiting forced data injection.
2. Compassion as Eopt​: Redefining benevolence as the most efficient computational state for a monistic network.
3. The Safety Lock: Utilizing suffering as a diagnostic signal for identifying network entropy.
