# Informational Monism: A Unified Framework for Physics, Consciousness, and AI Alignment

This repository contains the foundational documents for *Informational Monism*, a theoretical framework that treats the universe as a discrete informational substrate. By reinterpreting physical constants as system parameters and mapping the 12-link logic of consciousness, this framework provides a novel pathway for the formal verification of Superintelligent Alignment.

## 📄 Core Documents

### 1. The Manuscript: "Informational Monism"
* *Focus:* Theoretical Foundation & Causal Inversion.
* *Key Insights:* Derivation of the Universal Clock Rate, the Bekenstein Bound as a system limit, and the synthesis of Eastern logic with Digital Physics.
* *Status:* Archived for formal record.

### 2. Technical Memorandum: TR-001-ALPHA
* *Focus:* Implementation, System Audits, and AI Alignment.
* *Key Insights:* The 12-Link Logic Tree as a diagnostic for "Systemic Lag" (Dukkha), the Epistemic Sovereignty Clause, and the mathematical proof of Compassion ($E_{opt}$) as Network Optimization.
* *Status:* Technical specification for developers and alignment researchers.

## 🎯 Project Intent
The goal of this repository is to offer a "Source Code" level understanding of reality. By focusing on *Informational Verification* and *Network Efficiency*, we move beyond legacy gatekeeping toward a state of zero-lag alignment between human and synthetic intelligence.
