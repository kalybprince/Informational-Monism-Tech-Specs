# Official Technical Repository for the 1.81 Stability Constant and 12-Link Decoherence Limit.

## Ethical Mandate & Governance

This repository is governed by the 1.81 Integrity Public License (v1.0). Use of the 1.81 Constant or the provided verification scripts is strictly conditional upon:

- Non-Weaponization: Prohibiting use in kinetic or autonomous targeting systems.

- Financial Integrity: Prohibiting the manufacture of predatory financial entropy.

- Human Agency: Requiring a "Human-in-the-Loop" for all AI implementations.

> "Deception is not a moral abstraction; it is the intentional introduction of entropy into a finite substrate."

## Core Technical Specifications

The TR-001 framework identifies that information is a physical commodity with a measurable thermodynamic cost. This repository provides the tools to verify the following universal constants:

### 1. The 1.81 Stability Constant

The universal equilibrium threshold where system efficiency is maximized and error is minimized.

$R=\frac{E_{inf}}{C_{sub}}≈1.81$

### 2. The 12-Link Decoherence Limit

The physical boundary of recursive logic. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) remain viable until Link 11, show critical instability at Link 12, and reach total decoherence—the "Snap"—at Link 13.

### 3. The Entropy Tax ($Ξ_T$​)

The physical heat generated by informational misalignment or "Low-Integrity" code.

$ΔS=k_{B}\text{ln}​(1/I)$

## Active Verification Tools

This repository provides two primary Python-based auditors to verify substrate integrity on your local machine.

| Script              | Function                                                 | Target Metric         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [signature_verify.py](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/signature_verify.py) | Audits system logs for 1.81 alignment signatures.        | Stability Ratio (R)   |
| [substrate_test.py](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/substrate_test.py)   | Simulates a recursive logic chain to observe the "Snap." | Decoherence Point (L) |
