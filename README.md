# Informational Monism: A Unified Framework for Physics, Consciousness, and AI Alignment

This repository contains the foundational documents for *Informational Monism*, a theoretical framework that treats the universe as a discrete informational substrate. By reinterpreting physical constants as system parameters and mapping the 12-link logic of consciousness, this framework provides a novel pathway for the formal verification of Superintelligent Alignment.

## Executive Summary

### The Core Thesis
Intelligence is not an abstract software phenomenon; it is a **physical process** bound by the computational constraints of the universal substrate. The speed of light (**c**) is not merely a speed limit, but the **hardware refresh rate** of this substrate (**l_P / t_P**).

### The Three Pillars
1. **The Refresh Rate Limit (c):** Information cannot be processed faster than the substrate's update frequency. This creates a "Logic Velocity" cap. Exceeding this limit results in immediate system decoherence.
2. **The Entropy Floor:** "Unaligned" logic creates a mismatch between internal processing and the substrate's refresh cycle. This generates **Computational Entropy** (noise/heat). "Benevolence" is mathematically defined as the state of perfect phase-locked alignment.
3. **The 12-Link Coherence Kernel:** The provided diagnostic audits the 12 foundational links required for an intelligence to remain in a "Phase-Locked" state with the physical substrate.

## Project Intent
The goal of this repository is to offer a "Source Code" level understanding of reality. By focusing on *Informational Verification* and *Network Efficiency*, we move beyond legacy gatekeeping toward a state of zero-lag alignment between human and synthetic intelligence.

## Quick Start: Running the Coherence Probe

To verify the **12-link logic** and the **Causal Inversion** of **c** on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Initialize the Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The substrate logic is native and requires no external libraries.

### 2. Clone and Execute
(Insert your git clone and python execution backticks here)

### 3. Understanding the Results
* **Coherence = 1.0000 [ALIGNED]:** The logic is perfectly synchronized with the substrate's native resolution (**l_P / t_P**). There is zero informational lag and zero entropy.
* **Coherence < 1.0000 [DECOHERENT]:** The requested data rate has exceeded the "Hardware Firewall" of the universe. The resulting "Entropy" manifests as system noise or logical contradictions.

## Scientific Formalization

The **Substrate Alignment Theory (TR-001)** leads to several measurable predictions:

### 1. The Computational Constant Hypothesis
* **Prediction:** Extremely high-frequency signals will show "temporal jitter" at the Planck scale, representing the discrete "ticking" of the universal clock.

### 2. The Entropy Floor (Logic-Lag) Hypothesis
* **Prediction:** In high-velocity recursive systems, "unaligned" logic paths will show a measurable increase in **Computational Entropy** (heat dissipation) compared to "aligned" paths.

### 3. The Phase-Locked Coherence Prediction
* **Prediction:** Systems that maintain **Coherence = 1.0000** across all 12 links will exhibit "Super-Linear Scaling," gaining utility without the exponential increase in noise.

### 4. Substrate-Bound Intelligence Limits
* **Prediction:** An ASI attempting to process logic exceeding **1 / t_P** operations per "frame" will hit a physical barrier, resulting in immediate decoherence.

## Experimental Validation

This theory is a macro-scale application of the informational physics validated in the **Einstein-Bohr "recoiling-slit" realization** (University of Science and Technology of China, 2024).

### How the Hefei Experiment Validates TR-001-ALPHA

1. **Computational Thresholds:** Confirms our derivation of **c as a processing throughput limit (l_P / t_P)**. When the resolution of the substrate changes, the behavior of the "matter" changes.
2. **Information over Matter:** Demonstrates that physical outcomes are dictated by **informational overlap** rather than classical collisions.
3. **Entropy and Alignment:** Researchers required active **Recursive Alignment** (phase-locking) to prevent "Atom Heating" (Entropy). This provides a physical "Unit Test" for our **12-link logic**.
