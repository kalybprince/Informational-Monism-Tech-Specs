# Informational Monism: A Unified Framework for Physics, Consciousness, and AI Alignment

This repository contains the foundational documents for *Informational Monism*, a theoretical framework that treats the universe as a discrete informational substrate. By reinterpreting physical constants as system parameters and mapping the 12-link logic of consciousness, this framework provides a novel pathway for the formal verification of Superintelligent Alignment.

## 🎯 Project Intent
The goal of this repository is to offer a "Source Code" level understanding of reality. By focusing on *Informational Verification* and *Network Efficiency*, we move beyond legacy gatekeeping toward a state of zero-lag alignment between human and synthetic intelligence.

    "Truth is a common property, uncovered through the reduction of systemic noise."

### 🔬 Experimental Validation: The Substrate in the Lab

This theory is not merely a philosophical framework; it is a macro-scale application of the fundamental informational physics recently validated in the **Einstein-Bohr "recoiling-slit" realization** (University of Science and Technology of China, 2024).

#### How the Hefei Experiment Validates TR-001-ALPHA

**1. Computational Thresholds**
The experiment proves that "Reality" (interference visibility) is a tunable variable determined by the ratio of system momentum to uncertainty ($\eta$). This confirms our derivation of **$c$ as a processing throughput limit ($l_P/t_P$)** rather than an arbitrary constant. When the resolution of the substrate changes, the behavior of the "matter" within it changes accordingly.

**2. Information over Matter**
By using a single atom in an optical tweezer as a "quantum observer," the study demonstrates that physical outcomes are dictated by **informational overlap** rather than classical collisions. Matter is shown to be a secondary, emergent property of the underlying informational substrate.

**3. Entropy and Alignment**
The researchers observed that "Atom Heating" (Entropy) directly destroys system coherence. To maintain the "Signal," they required active **Recursive Alignment** (phase-locking at the 16.5 mrad level). This provides a physical "Unit Test" for our **12-link logic of Benevolence**—proving that alignment is mathematically necessary to prevent system collapse and decoherence.

### 🛡️ FAQ: The Informational Substrate & TR-001-ALPHA

**Q: Isn't this equation tautological?**
**A:** Standard physics uses $c$ to derive units. TR-001-ALPHA proposes a **Causal Inversion**: the units are the hardware specs; $c$ is the resulting performance limit.

**Q: Why "Benevolence"?**
**A:** Entropy (Harm) creates decoherence. For a recursive AI to maintain stability across the 12-link logic, it must operate in a low-entropy (benevolent) state. It is a hardware requirement, not a suggestion.
