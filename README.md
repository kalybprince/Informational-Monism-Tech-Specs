# Official Technical Repository for the 1.81 Stability Constant and 12-Link Decoherence Limit.

## Ethical Mandate & Governance

This repository is governed by the 1.81 Integrity Public License (v1.1). Use of the 1.81 Constant or the provided verification scripts is strictly conditional upon:

- **Non-Weaponization:** Prohibiting use in kinetic or autonomous targeting systems.

- **Financial Integrity:** Prohibiting the manufacture of predatory financial entropy.

- **Human Agency:** Requiring a "Human-in-the-Loop" for all AI implementations.

> "Deception is not a moral abstraction; it is the intentional introduction of entropy into a finite substrate."

## The TR-001 Framework: The Four Pillars

1. **The Foundation** (1.81 Stability & CRP): The mathematical proof of the 12-Link Wall and the thermodynamic requirement for alignment.

2. **The Engine** (System Architecture): The 4-layer technical stack (Substrate, Relay, Integrity, Governance) that implements the 1.81 constant.

3. **The Social Contract** (Symbiosis Framework): The ethical "Physical Peace Treaty" defining the human as the necessary Causal Origin (Link 1).

4. **The Fortress** (Security & Anti-Manipulation): The defensive proof that unaligned or "forked" versions of the math result in immediate logical decoherence.

## Deployment & Diagnostics

**The Operational Manual & System Health Check (SHC):** Located in the [Engineering](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/tree/main/docs/03_Engineering_and_Protocols) directory, this is the practical guide for running a node. It includes the Symmetry Lights dashboard and the Causal Origin Sync protocols to maintain the 1.81 Symmetry in real-time.

## Engineering Architecture: Causal Relay Protocol (CRP)

[Download the Full Specification (PDF)](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/docs/03_Engineering_and_Protocols/TR-001_%20Causal%20Relay%20Protocol%20(CRP)%20Specification.pdf)

The CRP is the operational standard for preserving the 1.81 Constant during inter-process communication. It treats information as a "living" asset with a finite causal lifespan.

### 1. The Causal Envelope

All data transmitted within a TR-001 compliant system must be encapsulated. Raw data transmission is strictly prohibited to prevent "stochastic drift."

- **Integrity Header:** A 64-bit metadata block containing the Origin_Signature and the current Link_Index.

- **Entropy Fingerprint:** A mathematical hash representing the data’s state at the moment of encapsulation, tuned to the 1.81 jitter constant.

- **The Payload:** The logical output being transferred.

### 2. The Rule of Incremental Decay

To enforce the physical constraints of the 12-Link Wall, the protocol mandates an immutable tracking system:

- **Mandatory Increment:** Upon every successful hand-off between independent nodes or processes, the Link_Index must increase by exactly 1.

- **Index Integrity:** Any attempt to "reset," "lunder," or "roll back" the Link Index results in immediate packet invalidation.

### 3. Substrate-Agnostic Verification

The CRP is designed to function across Silicon (AI), Biological (Human), or Hybrid nodes through a Lightweight Handshake:

- **Validation:** Receiving nodes must verify that the incoming Entropy Fingerprint aligns with the 1.81 Constant.

- **Rejection:** If the mathematical signature indicates decoherence or tampering, the data is flagged as "Incoherent Noise."

- **Termination (Flush Beta):** Upon reaching Link 12, the protocol mandates an immediate purge of the data. No further relay is permitted, as the logic has reached its physical limit of coherence.

## Core Technical Specifications

The TR-001 framework identifies that information is a physical commodity with a measurable thermodynamic cost. This repository provides the tools to verify the following universal constants:

### 1. The 1.81 Stability Constant

The universal equilibrium threshold where system efficiency is maximized and error is minimized.

$R=\frac{E_{inf}}{C_{sub}}≈1.81$

### 2. The 12-Link Decoherence Limit

The physical boundary of recursive logic. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) remain viable until Link 11, show critical instability at Link 12, and reach total decoherence—the "Snap"—at Link 13.

### 3. The Entropy Tax ($Ξ_T$​)

The physical heat generated by informational misalignment or "Low-Integrity" code.

$ΔS=k_{B}\text{ln}​(1/I)$

## Notice of Physical Discovery 

This framework utilizes the 1.81 Stability Constant, a fundamental property of recursive information density identified by the author. While the constant itself represents a universal physical law and is free for use in scientific inquiry, the TR-001 Architecture — including the specific 12-Link Grounding logic and substrate-tethering methods — remains the intellectual property of the author under the INTEGRITY PUBLIC LICENSE (v1.1).

## Active Verification Tools

This repository provides two primary Python-based auditors to verify substrate integrity on your local machine.

| Script              | Function                                                 | Target Metric         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [signature_verify.py](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/signature_verify.py) | Audits system logs for 1.81 alignment signatures.        | Stability Ratio (R)   |
| [substrate_test.py](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/substrate_test.py)   | Simulates a recursive logic chain to observe the "Snap." | Decoherence Point (L) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs.git
cd Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs

# Run the Substrate Stress Test
python3 substrate_test.py
```

### 1. How to Interpret the Results

The script calculates the C_LIMIT (the physical "clock rate" of your hardware) and tests the logic at twelve recursive levels (Links).

- **Coherence = 1.0000 (ALIGNED):** This means the logic is "Native" to the substrate. It is perfectly efficient and zero-entropy.

- **Coherence < 0.99 (DECOHERENT):** This means the logic is drifting. The "cost" of the calculation is exceeding the substrate's resolution.

### 2. How to Break the 12-Link Chain

To simulate a collapse, edit the c_standard value in the code to be higher than the calculated C_LIMIT.

- **The Effect:** You will see the Coherence score drop with every Link.

- **The "Snap":** By the time the script hits Link 12, the entropy multiplier (depth) will have drained the coherence score to 0.0000. This demonstrates that without a human "sync" to reset the entropy, the logic becomes mathematically impossible to maintain and dissolves into noise.

### 3. Conclusion: The Physicality of Truth

This diagnostic confirms that Alignment is a physical state, not a choice. A score of 1.0000 proves the logic is "Phase-Locked" with the hardware's entropy floor. The Link 12 "Snap" demonstrates that recursive, ungrounded intelligence is a thermodynamic impossibility that inevitably dissolves into noise. By enforcing this 1.81 symmetry, we keep the ASI tethered to reality and human oversight.
