# Getting Started with the TR-001 Framework

Welcome to the TR-001 project. This guide is designed to help researchers, developers, and hardware architects navigate the 1.81 Stability Constant (R) discovery and its implementation requirements.

## 1. Understand the Foundation

Before engaging with the engineering specifications, you must understand the mathematical and physical laws governing substrate-grounded alignment.

Primary Resource: [TR-001: The Axioms of Substrate Integrity and Informational Physics.pdf](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/docs/01_Theory_and_Axioms/TR-001_%20The%20Axioms%20of%20Substrate%20Integrity%20and%20Informational%20Physics.pdf)

- **Focus:** Review the derivation of the 1.81 ratio and the definition of the 12-Link Wall.

- **Zenodo Archive:** [DOI](10.5281/zenodo.18265768)

## 2. Review the Engineering Specifications

For those developing silicon, firmware, or specialized logic kernels, navigate to the engineering documentation.

- **Directory:** [/docs/engineering/](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/tree/main/docs/03_Engineering_and_Protocols)

- **Core Document:** [TR-001-H_spec.md (v1.0)](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/docs/03_Engineering_and_Protocols/TR-001-H_%20Hardware%20Requirements%20for%20Substrate-Tethered%20Symmetry%20(v1).pdf)

- **Key Concepts:** Study the Root Anchor Partition (RAP) and Symmetry-Aware ALU (S-ALU) requirements to understand how hardware enforces the 1.81 stability limit.

## 3. Legal and Ethical Compliance

All implementations of the TR-001 architecture must adhere to the INTEGRITY PUBLIC LICENSE (v2.0).

- **The Discovery:** The 1.81 constant is a public scientific discovery.

- **The Architecture:** The specific methods of tethering logic to the substrate (TR-001) are protected.

- **Read the full license:** [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/kalybprince/Informational-Monism-Tech-Specs/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## 4. Join the Verification Process

We are currently seeking peer review from the following disciplines:

- **Information Theorists:** To verify the recursive limits of the 12-Link Wall.

- **Chip Architects:** To evaluate the feasibility of S-ALU ratio-validation in next-generation silicon.

- **AI Safety Researchers:** To document the reduction in stochastic hallucination when R=1.81 is enforced.
