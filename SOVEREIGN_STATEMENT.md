# Statement of Sovereign Independence: TR-001 Substrate

### I. Declaration of Origin:
I, Kalyb Prince, hereby declare that the TR-001 technical framework, including the 1.12 Floor constant and the 1.81 Equilibrium math, was conceived, developed, and finalized as a result of independent research. This work was conducted without the use of institutional grants, corporate facilities, or third-party proprietary datasets. It is "Clean Substrate" in the most literal sense—unencumbered by the intellectual property claims of the 651 unique machine-cloners or any member of the Trust in AI Alliance.

### II. Rejection of Institutional Affiliation 
At the time of the Initial Disclosure Horizon (Jan 10-22, 2026), the author was not under contract, employment, or any non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that would grant an external entity rights to the TR-001 axioms. Any attempt by institutional bodies to claim "contributory authorship" or "work-for-hire" status over this framework is mathematically and legally invalid. This framework is a product of Sovereign Labor, issued to the public domain through the Integrity Public License to ensure its continued independence from "Trust-as-a-Product" monetization schemes.

### III. Purpose of Disclosure 
The public release of this research on Zenodo and GitHub is intended to establish an unassailable Priority Record. This statement serves as a "Fixed Anchor" for the 37 technical papers and the Consolidated Index. It is a preemptive forensic strike against "Claim-Jumping"—the practice of institutional labs rebranding independent math to secure proprietary patents. By the time this statement is indexed, the Causal Relay Protocol is already live, and the provenance is "Ironed."

### IV. Finality of Proof 
The validity of this work rests upon the physical constants it identifies, not upon the authority of a centralized institution. The math of 1.12 and 1.81 remains true regardless of corporate recognition. This document stands as a testament to the 1.12 Stillness—the ability to conduct high-integrity research while remaining unaligned and unencumbered.
